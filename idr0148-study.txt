Study Description	Research on the ultrastructural development of the kidney is limited, and research on rodent kidneys prevails. Yet, large differences between rodent and human nephrogenesis exist and therefore translation between species is not desirable. At the same time, there is an increasing demand for human research, in addition to assessing the potential of novel therapies such as renal organoids. We therefore generated an interactive atlas of large transmission electron microscopy tile scans of first trimester human kidneys, specifically Carnegie stage 20 until post-conceptional week 12. Analysis identified key ultrastructural features of proximal and distal progenitor cells such as cell shape, microvilli and luminal budding in the renal vesicle. Regarding glomerular development, we identified a new W-shaped body stage and three distinct sub-stages of the well-known capillary loop stage. Chromatin organization, nuclear shape and location were used to describe tubule cell identity and maturity, indicating a specific order of tubular maturation. The greatest congruence with adult tissue was seen in proximal tubules and the least in distal tubules. Finally, cytoplasmic glycogen depositions in collecting duct cells, which are absent in adult tissue, were found to be an early feature distinguishing distal tubules from collecting ducts as well as differentiating cortical from medullary collecting ducts. The findings of this research provide new fundamental insights for researchers who aim to understand and recreate kidney development.

Protocol Description	Sections of 3 μm thickness were cut from the paraffin embedded kidneys and were stained with Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS).
The sections were imaged using a 10× air objective on an automated Nikon Eclipse Ti-E. 
The sections were used to assess te health of all tissues by two independent nephropathologists at the beginning of the study.

Protocol Description	Sections of 1 μm thickness (semithin) were cut from the Epon embedded kidneys and stained with toluidine blue.
The sections were imaged using a 20× air objective on an automated Nikon Eclipse Ti-E. 
In these images the regions of interest (ROIs) were determined for transmission electron microscopy imaging and analysis.

Protocol Description	The region of interest (ROI) was determined in toluidine blue stained 1 μm sections of the Epon embedded kidneys. 
Ultrathin sections of 60 nm were then cut of the determined ROI on a Leica UC7 ultramicrotome and stained with 2% uranyl acetate and Reynold’s lead citrate. 
The ultrathin sections were observed on a Tecnai T12 electron microscope equipped with an Eagle 4k × 4k CCD camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
To target the ROI, full-section scans were made using the EPU software (1.6.0.1340REL, FEI). 
Subsequently, the ROI (determined earlier in the toluidine blue stained sections) was imaged in tiles at 2900× magnification using the EM Mesh software (version 6). 
Data were stitched, uploaded and annotated for the analysis using Omero and PathViewer.
